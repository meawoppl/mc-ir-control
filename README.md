About
=====

This is a library based on the work of Sebastian Setz for the IR contol 
of many different camera brands and models.  The original project website 
can be found here:
http://sebastian.setz.name/arduino/my-libraries/multi-camera-ir-control/

It has been significantly dissected and tweaked to run on the Spark-core.  
Bug-Reports/patches/success-stories all welcome.  

Tested by MRG on:
 * Canon T1i
 * Canon 20d
 * Sony Nex-6

Example Usage
=============

To use this library, you must do two things
 # Wire and IR-LED to a digital output pin
 # Declare the camera type

From there, the API is quite simple:
